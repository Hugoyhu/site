    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p>
        I'm Hugo. I'm currently a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School, and I'm interested in hardware engineering, logistics and photography.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm currently an intern for <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a> working on PCB design and procurement for <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/blot">Blot</a>, a programmable drawing machine for generative art. Previously, I've done hardware engineering for a game console called <a href="https://sprig.hackclub.com">Sprig</a>, helped organize <a href="https://assemble.hackclub.com">Assemble</a>, a hackathon in San Francisco in 2022​, and worked as Mail Team Coordinator, where I took on a plethora of challenges such as lowering shipping costs for domestic and especially international outbound parcels, improving customs clearance and delivery abroad, and integrated modern postal technologies like Intelligent Mail.
        <br>
        <br>
        I greatly enjoy making fun personal projects that interest me in my free time. I'm currently working on building a IMX6 based board that runs linux. There are also some previous projects I have done on my <a href="https://github.com/Hugoyhu">GitHub.</a>

        <br>

        I have a small portfolio of my photography <a href="https://corgis.cyou">here</a> if you're interested in taking a look.
