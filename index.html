    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p>
        I'm Hugo. I'm currently a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School, and I'm interested in logistics, hardware engineering, and photography.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm currently a summer intern for <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a> working on PCB design and procurement for <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/haxidraw">Haxidraw</a>, a programmable drawing machine for generative art. Previously, I worked with hardware engineering for <a href="https://sprig.hackclub.com">Sprig</a>, a game console that provided a platform for beginners with little-to-no experience in coding to develop games in a web editor​, and helped organize <a
            href="https://assemble.hackclub.com">Assemble</a>​, the first major in-person hackathon since COVID. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For more than two years, I've been Mail Team Coordinator for Hack Club, where I took on a plethora of challenges such as lowering shipping costs for domestic and especially international outbound parcels, improving customs clearance and delivery abroad, and integrated modern postal technologies like Intelligent Mail.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also design PCBs for fun and work with hobbyist hardware as well. I've worked extensively with a wide variety of microcontrollers across many platforms and architectures. I'm currently designing a custom wireless BLE mechanical keyboard, and I'm also exploring the technical aspects of designs around ARM-based CPUs.
