    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Hugo. I do logistics for <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, am an active community member, and
        work as Mail Team Coordinator.
        I went on <a href="https://zephyr.hackclub.com">The Hacker Zephyr</a> and helped organize <a
            href="https://assemble.hackclub.com">Assemble</a>,
        an in-person hackathon at Figma HQ in San Francisco from August 5th to 7th, 2022. We created a hackathon
        renaissance to spark more high-quality,
        in-person hackathons across the country.

        <br>
        <br>

        I am currently a freshman at <a href="https://stuy.enschool.org">Stuyvesant High School</a>.
        I am heavily interested in logistics and improving Hack Club's logistics flow, including enhancing user
        experience, creating more efficient workflows, lowering costs, and
        designing scalable mail projects to deliver mail to hundreds worldwide.

        <br>
        <br>

        I design hardware for fun, as well as software for logistics. I am building a library to develop mail
        applications for Slack and the web.
