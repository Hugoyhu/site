    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Hugo. I do logistics for <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, am an active community member, and
        work as Mail Team Coordinator.
        I went on <a href="https://zephyr.hackclub.com">The Hacker Zephyr</a> and helped organize <a
            href="https://assemble.hackclub.com">Assemble</a>,
        an in-person hackathon at Figma HQ in San Francisco from August 5th to 7th, 2022. We created a hackathon
        renaissance to spark more high-quality, in-person hackathons across the country.

        <br>
        <br>

        I am currently a freshman at <a href="https://stuy.enschool.org">Stuyvesant High School</a>.

        <br>
        <br>

        I'm heavily interested and experienced in logistics. I manage Hack Club's mail system, enhance mail experiences,
        create efficient workflows, negotiate lower costs with carriers, and design scalable mail projects to deliver
        mail to hundreds worldwide.

        I also work with some special projects, such as <a href="sprig.hackclub.com">Sprig</a>, a limited-edition game
        console designed by Hack Club.

        <br>
        <br>

        I design hardware for fun, as well as software for logistics. I am building a library to develop mail
        applications for Slack and the web.

        <br>
        <br>

        <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a> is an international network of high school coding clubs. We are a
        501c3 nonprofit, and our <a href="https://bank.hackclub.com/hq">finances are transparent.</a> <a
            href="https://hackclub.com/slack/?continent=North+America">Hack Club Slack</a> is the best place
        on the internet for technical teenagers, and <a href="https://hackclub.com/bank/">Hack Club Bank</a> is the best
        platform to run an event, club, or nonprofit organization.
