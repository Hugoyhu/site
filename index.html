    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Hugo. I do logistics for <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, am an active community member, and
        work as Mail Team Coordinator.
        I went on <a href="https://zephyr.hackclub.com">The Hacker Zephyr</a> and helped organize <a
            href="https://assemble.hackclub.com">Assemble</a>,
        an in-person hackathon at Figma HQ in San Francisco from August 5th to 7th, 2022. We created a hackathon
        renaissance to spark more high-quality, in-person hackathons across the country.

        <br>
        <br>

        I am currently a freshman at Stuyvesant High School.

        <br>

        I'm heavily interested and experienced in logistics. Over the past two years, I've updated Hack Club's mail processes to lower costs while improving quality. Recently, I've been invested in elevating mail experiences through unique and memorable mailpieces, and integrating postal technologies like Intelligent Mail. 

        I also work with certain special projects, such as <a href="https://sprig.hackclub.com">Sprig</a>, a limited-edition game
        console designed by Hack Club, where I helped design the hardware and brought the boards to production. I'm also currently working on <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/haxidraw">Haxidraw</a>, a drawing robot.

        <br>
        <br>

        I design hardware for fun, as well as software for logistics. I am building a library to develop mail
        applications for Slack and the web.
